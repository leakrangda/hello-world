# hello-world
thanks god that created human with knowledge and desire, though those the one that drift them from heaven.

going on journey, dont wake me.
i love to going alone, love the sound of two feet.
i am a drifter, not know where to go.
nor i wish for someone.

i am a drifter, let all dream fly, and floating to the sky.
